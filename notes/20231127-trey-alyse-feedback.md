## Cuts

### Trey

20 slides is too many! Need to cut things.

A lot of the slides could go on for 10 minutes themselves. Re-use them as optional
slides for Q&A.

Cut before recording. There's too much to cut post-recording; it would be janky!

Have to be really high level, short story. We're going to have to cut out meaty things.
"Hooks" to pull people in.


## Tell a shorter story

### Trey

* Our goal/problem
* How did we achieve the goals?
* What are the takeaways without going in to the details of any particular area. Tease
  people to go to the blog post.
* End with the blog post.
* My email if you have questions. QGreenland email? GitHub Discussions QR code


### Alyse

* 1 slide: goal/problem
* 1 slide: solution/approach
* 1 slide: meat of the solution
* 1 slide: outcomes, why you should do it
* 1 slide: how you can do it

Sometimes at AGU first slide is a preview of the whole presentation.

* Thesis: How to make an online computing environment for a workshop that's globally accessible
* Why am I speaking? Share what we learned.


## Intro

### Alyse

~~Keep intro short. Introduce self, not rest of team.~~

"What is QGreenland" in 5 seconds. PICTURE!! and QR code. Emphasize responsibility to
educate. Introduce this before or after setting up the problem? Whatever feels more
natural.

### Trey

Make it really obvious from the start that people are in the right place and
presentation is what they expected.


## Video demo

### Alyse

There is a recording of the QGreenland workshop, will make it available on OneDrive or
something. reach out if urgent! Maybe re-usable footage!

Stills to use on slides!
