title: "Feedback from Twila on outline draft 1"
---

My notes taken during a feedback meeting with Twila. Sorry if some of this shorthand is
only clear to me :)

* *Purpose*: 1-3 goals that seem worth emphasizing
* *Purpose related to outcome*: 
* "Broadband access is still a limiting factor in many parts of the world"
    * We can only do so much within the system
* "Hourglass" metaphor for writing: Forest -> trees -> forest
* Community-wide problem of providing technical training
    * Technical solutions and mitigations exist
    * Resources for replicating our work (e.g. Jupyter Blog post)
    * Still existing problem: Cost! Requires expertise (2i2c); how to reduce the
      barriers?
* Remember the audience is cryosphere folks. For most people listening, they should
  check out CryoCloud!
* Accessibility and inclusion goals apply both specifically to our workshop and in a
  community sense.
* Logos: QGreenland, CryoCloud, NSF, NSIDC, NASA
* Title slide: authors, co-authors, affiliations
* Look at past AGU slides from QGreenland OneDrive
* Title statements can be very short and help build a narrative at a high level
* "What is QGreenland?" slide: Can find from other talks.
    * "What is QGIS?"
* QR code and/or link to Jupyter Blog post
    * anywhere I don't want to go in to more details
    * AND end of presentation?
* Link (QR code) to QGreenland workshop
