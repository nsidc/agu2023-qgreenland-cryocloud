## In this presentation...

* **A problem in our community**: Technical training is hard!
* **(Part of) the solution**: Teaching on a JupyterHub to reduce distractions, improve
  accessibility, and enhance learning. _A [**QGreenland**]{.qgreenland-red}
  workshop collaboration success story._
* **How you can do it to**: Check out [**CryoCloud**](https://cryointhecloud.com)!

:::{.notes}
Technical training is hard. Technical training about Earth science data is especially
hard, and often requires a complex software environment.

Teaching on a JupyterHub enables learners and instructors to focus more of their time on
learning and less of it on troubleshooting.

This could be an option for your next workshop!

:::{.notes}
I'm Matt Fisher:

* Mid-career software developer
* Working at NSIDC
* Author, with Trey Stafford, of the QGreenland software
* Instructor, with Trey Stafford and Alyse Thurber, of QGreenland Researcher Workshop
  this year. More on that soon! At the time, both Trey and myself were new to developing
  technical training and acting as instructor, so we learned a lot as we went.

If anything in this talk goes by too quickly, there will be a QR code at the final slide
linking to the webpage for this presentation. There you can find a copy of the slides
(including bonus slides), learn more about authors of this talk, and find several links
we think you might be interested in.

_Read the text._

Community education and outreach, and therefore workshops, are important parts of our
grant-funded activities.

# A problem in our community

Technical training is hard!

:::{.notes}
Planning and administering technical training is hard.

We need to consider your topic carefully, and make sure it's sized right for the time
you have.

We need to build up knowledge in the correct order.

We need to design exercises that will help learners remember their new knowledge.

We need to figure out how breakout rooms in Zoom work.

On top of these things, we need to worry about how learners will set up technical
requirements. For our workshop, do we need loaner laptops? Do we need a Mac expert and a
Windows expert on the teaching team?
:::


## :desktop_computer: Variance in user systems

:::{.fragment}
* Hardware, operating system, and user comfort level
:::

:::{.fragment}
* User configuration
    * Installed programming languages & versions
    * Dependency managers & installed dependency locations
:::

:::{.fragment}
:point_up: **Takes time away from teaching, planning, and learning.**
:::

:::{.notes}
In this talk, we'll zoom in on variance in user systems as a distraction from all the
other important things we just talked about.

* I'm only comfortable with one **operating system** myself.

* Many learners' **user configurations**, like mine, are customized.

* We all, learners and instructors, only have so much time and attention to give.
:::


## ü¶ª Accessibility

Hardware and operating systems are expensive.

Accessibility is our responsibility!

:::{.notes}
Hardware is expensive, and operating systems are expensive.

Not everyone has the time to set up their user configuration and install dependencies
for a workshop.

This is an accessibility barrier!

As course administrators, we have a responsibility to accessibility. The more accessible
our workshop activities and materials are, the more people can learn from them.

:::

:::{.fragment}
:unicorn: Minimize or eliminate distractions from system variance
:::

:::{.notes}
We want to run a virtual workshop that's accessible to researchers around the world at
all career levels.

Because we're teaching FAIR scientific data principles, we want our workshop to also
embody those principles. We gave ourselves a star where we think we did particularly
well.

* F: Our workshop is available as a website and as a public Git repository. We're doing
  outreach to share the materials and outcomes.
* A: Anyone can contribute to or learn from our materials using open protocols
  (HTTP/Git). We provided a small stipend to support equitable participation.
* I: Our source materials are in a common authoring format: Markdown
* R: We bundled documentation to support others re-running our workshop.

Our workshop requires users to be able to run QGreenland and install several
dependencies, including GDAL and optionally Git. It's important these are all at
versions compatible with the materials. We really don't want this to be a distraction
from learning!

:::


:::{.notes}
25 learners from all career stages, representing Germany, Poland, India, France, Canada,
and the US completed our workshop. Our only technical prerequisites were Internet access
and a browser.

NOTE: Internet access is no small barrier to participation, but our format enabled
international participation without requiring travel, which we felt was important.

We reduced the costs of setting up compute infrastructure from an expected $4500 to only
$75 in cloud costs for a 3-day workshop.

We produced open-source educational materials that will be useful even now that our
workshop is complete.

And we did outreach activities like a guest post on the _Jupyter Blog_ to share what we
learned.

There will be a QR code on the last slide that will include a link to our workshop
materials, details about outcomes, and the _Jupyter Blog_ post.

*CryoCloud _JupyterHub_ to the rescue!*

:::{.notes}
Colleagues with the _CryoCloud_ project run a _JupyterHub_ which aims to transition the
NASA research community to cloud and open source work patterns, and this aligns well
with our workshop goals.

The JupyterHub is operated by _International Interactive Computing Collaboration_, a
fiscally-sponsored non-profit.

* Look, we're in the browser, starting off on the AGU website, then navigating to
  `CryoInTheCloud.com`
* We'll navigate to their _JupyterHub_ link, click "login"
* We have a few options for our cloud server that'll be provisioned. I want Python, and
  1 CPU.
* This loading part is in real-time
* My JupyterLab cloud instance is ready!
* Just fast forwarding through pointing out a few cool things JupyterLab can do, like
  previewing GeoJSON...
* Let's open the desktop
* Let's navigate to and open QGreenland
* Let's just explore some stuff that looks interesting. I'm looking at the "Runoff"
  variable from the RACMO climate model.
* This looks cool, so I want to see satellite imagery of the area.
* I found a neat looking feature, so I decided to measure it, and it's a bit over 4km
  across.
* You can of course use any other QGIS analysis or processing features. This is just to
  share how smooth the desktop experience feels in the cloud!

This talk is more focused on how this helped us improve learning outcomes; if you want
technical detail on this subject, check out our _Jupyter Blog_ post! QR code on the last
slide.

:::{.notes}
As you saw in a previous slide, setting up a cloud _JupyterHub_ with all the features
you need for your workshop can be expensive. Because of this, collaborating with an
existing community was essential if we wanted to pursue this strategy.

We were fortunate to have established connections with _CryoCloud_ to help us get
started, but I think communities in this space are eager for collaborators. We brought
value to all future users of the hub by making QGIS and QGreenland readily available,
and we helped grow the community by onboarding our learners as new users.

If you're looking to run a workshop, consider an existing community to collaborate with,
like CryoCloud!

On our last slide, follow the QR code to find a link to a list of all 2i2c JupyterHubs,
that's a great starting place! There appear to be around 70 running hubs.

If you're looking to fund these type of activities, consider doing it through operating
a _JupyterHub_ community!

# :tada: Bonus slides


## :thumbsdown: Distractions

:thumbsdown: Distractions contribute to learners' cognitive load and reduce learning
effectiveness.

:thumbsdown: Distractions consume teaching time.

:thumbsdown: Distractions consume planning time.


:::{.notes}
_TODO: Make text on slide more succinct, move wordy stuff into notes_

Planning: How many helpers do we need? What prep-work do we need participants to do
(installing software, etc.)? Do we need loaner hardware? This time could be better spent
on curriculum.

## :handshake: A mutually-beneficial collaboration

:::{.fragment}
#### :money_with_wings: Reduced costs by collaborating!

> :thumbsdown: ~~2-4 weeks + ~$4500 to set up~~
>
> :thumbsup: 2-3 days to setup + ~$75 cloud costs
:::

:::{.fragment}
#### :sparkles: Contributed new functionality to the _CryoCloud_ hub

> :open_hands: **Open-source desktop GIS in the cloud!**
>
> :tada: **11** Pull Requests merged; **9** issues opened
:::


:::{.notes}
CryoCloud & QGreenland both benefitted from this arrangement.

* Reduced costs benefit our workshop participants by allowing us to focus more on
  teaching
    * Without: $4500 + 2-4 weeks setup
    * With: $0 + 2-3 days setup + $75 cloud operating expenses

* CryoCloud is an inclusive open source project. Running workshops helps expand
  CryoCloud's (and other hubs!) capabilities:
    * We merged **11** PRs and opened **9** issues to help improve CryoCloud.
    * We collaborated with 2i2c and CryoCloud to enable QGIS, an open source desktop GIS
      application that competes with ArcGIS,
      to be used effectively in the cloud by a classroom-sized group, to do real data
      analysis. This involved...
        * MIME type fixes so QGIS project files open when double-clicked.
        * Performance improvements so QGIS projects could load as fast as they do on
          local compute.
        * Demo on upcoming slide.
    * Misc. improvements:
        * Upgrading important dependencies like Git
        * Fixing support for man pages
        * Adding utilities our users and instructors would need
        * Improving documentation
        * Improving CI/CD automations
        * Eliminating warnings that distract from learning

:::{.notes}
* Running workshops helps expand the CryoCloud community
* Running workshops helps the CryoCloud team gather data (e.g. surveys) to measure their
  impact.

* We published a
  [Jupyter Blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/desktop-gis-software-in-the-cloud-with-jupyterhub-ddced297019a)
  describing our advancements. There will be a QR code at the end.
    * As a result, 2i2c reported increased requests from their clients for the
      functionality we demonstrated in our blog post.
    * More _JupyterHubs_ adopted QGIS desktop functionality.
