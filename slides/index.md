## QGreenland

What is QGreenland?

:::{.notes}
_TODO: Copy from a previous AGU presentation. Emphasize that community education and
outreach, and therefore workshops, are important parts of our activities._

_TODO: Talk about how we're going in to this with little experience?_

_TODO: Does CryoCloud belong here to? Or is it OK to get to it later?_
:::


# A community problem

Technical training is hard!

:::{.notes}
Planning and administering technical training is hard.

_TODO: Why? All the things..._
:::


## Variance in user systems

An added challenge that distracts from learning.

* Hardware, operating system, and user comfort level

* User configuration
    * Installed programming languages & versions
    * Dependency managers & installed dependency locations

:::{.notes}
_TODO: Step through bullets?_

Hardware, OS: I'm only comfortable with one operating system myself.
:::


## Accessibility

Lack of accessibility can be a distraction[^1].

Hardware and operating systems are a financial barrier to learning!

Mention UDL guidelines[^2]?

> UDL places responsibility for accessibility on the course designer
> rather than on the learner[^3]

[^1]: TODO
[^2]: <https://udlguidelines.cast.org/>{target="_blank"}
[^3]: [Carpentries Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/09-eia.html#universal-design-in-learning-udl){target="_blank"}

:::{.notes}
_TODO: Is this the right place to talk about accessibility? Feels like no_

Hardware is expensive, and operating systems are expensive.

Not everyone has the time to set up their user configuration for a workshop.

Accessibility isn't just about finances; it also means involving people
with disabilities in decision-making. We surveyed our attendees to accommodate
disabilities, but we did not involve people with disabilities in our decision-making.
Important to point out?
:::


## Distractions: :thumbsdown:

:thumbsdown: Distractions contribute to learners' cognitive load and reduce learning effectiveness[^1].

:thumbsdown: Distractions consume teaching time.

:thumbsdown: Distractions consume planning time.

[^1]: TODO

:::{.notes}
_TODO: Make text on slide more succinct, move wordy stuff into notes_

Planning: How many helpers do we need? What prep-work do we need participants to do
(installing software, etc.)? Do we need loaner hardware? This time could be better spent
on curriculum.
:::


## QGreenland workshop's objective/purpose

#### :satellite: Run a virtual workshop

#### :unicorn: Minimize or eliminate distractions from participants' unique systems

:::{.notes}
_TODO: Title..._

_TODO: Speaker notes_

_TODO: Where to touch on Internet access as a barrier? Here, under "virtual workshop"?
Or next slide? Or both? Set up the requirement here, and then go in to the concern on
the next slide?_
:::


## QGreenland workshop outcomes

:student: 25 learners

:globe_with_meridians: _TODO: List of countries_

:woman_scientist: Early- and late-career researchers


:::{.notes}
Our workshop was able to serve 25 international learners, including `{list of
countries}`, from career levels `{career level range}`, while limiting technical
prerequisites to Internet access and a browser.

_TODO: Better term than late-career?_

_TODO: Talk about cost here?_

Internet access is no small barrier to participation, but enabled international
participation without requiring travel, which we felt was important.
:::


## How we got there

*CryoCloud to the rescue!*

:::{.notes}
Colleagues with the _CryoCloud_ project run a JupyterHub which aims to transition the
NASA research community to cloud and open source work patterns, and this aligns well
with our workshop goals.
:::

---

* *JupyterHub* to the rescue! Colleagues with the _CryoCloud_ project run a JupyterHub
  which aims to transition the NASA research community to cloud and open source work
  patterns, and this aligns well with our workshop goals.

* Explained in layers
    * Jupyter Notebooks: Literate programming file format. Can be edited and viewed with
      various tools.
    * Jupyter Lab: A comprehensive browser-based environment for using Jupyter
      Notebooks, with everything else (terminal, image previewer, tabular data editor,
      ...) you might need.
    * JupyterHub: JupyterLab deployed in the cloud so anyone can create a Lab on demand.

* Working with an existing commmunity benefitted both:
    * Running workshops helps the CryoCloud team gather data
    * Running workshops helps expand CryoCloud's capabilities (we contributed `{N}` PRs
      to the open-source project)
    * Running workshops helps expand the CryoCloud community
    * Reduced costs benefit our workshop participants by allowing us to focus more on
      teaching
        * Without: $4500 + 2-4 weeks setup
        * With: $0 + 2-3 days setup + $75 cloud operating expenses

* _TODO:_ Point to CryoCloud's & Openscapes' sessions/tutorials.
    * Twila: Last slide, or slide before conclusion. QR code? Also use the identifier
      for the presentation. Poster number, title.
* _TODO:_ "Sounds like you knew the right people to get this opportunity to use a
  JupyterHub." Yes! There are multiple communities running hubs, however, and I think
  many are looking to similarly exercise their capabilities. Look at the list of hubs
  run by 2i2c for opportunities to collaborate.


## Outcome bigger picture

* Twila: Highlight how other people can benefit from what we learned.
