## TODO

* Use _POP_ method? Appropriate?


## Intro

Lay out the problem...

* Planning & administering technical training is hard

* Variance in user systems can make it harder!
    * Hardware, operating system, and user comfort level
        * I'm personally comfortable with only one very specific operating system
    * User configuration: 
        * Installed programming languages & versions
        * Dependency managers & installed dependency locations
    * Inclusion and accessibility are important for learning; lack of these is a
      distraction or barrier to participation!
        * Accessibility: Hardware is expensive, and operating systems are expensive.
          Not everyone has the time to set up their user configuration for a workshop.
            * [Accommodation vs Universal design](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/09-eia.html#from-accommodation-to-universal-design)
            * [Universal Design in Learning (UDL)](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/09-eia.html#universal-design-in-learning-udl)
                * > UDL places responsibility for accessibility on the course designer
                  > rather than on the learner
        * Inclusion: It doesn't matter what your operating system or hardware
          preferences are. Your user configuration can be totally unique, and as long as
          you have a browser, you can participate.

* Issues caused by system variance are distractions
    * Distractions contribute to cognitive load and reduce learning effectiveness
        * TODO: Cite.
    * Distractions take time to resolve at run time.
    * Distractions take time to plan for: how many helpers do we need?

* *Purpose*: Run a virtual workshop that eliminates distractions from system variance

* *Outcome*: Our workshop was able to serve 25 international learners, including
  `{list of countries}`, from career levels `{career level range}`, while limiting
  technical prerequisites to Internet access and a browser.
    * Internet access is no small barrier to participation, but enabled international
      participation without requiring travel, which we felt was important.
